## Loan default Prediction

This is an end-to-end project building a classification model to predict loan default for ABC Bank using the [Berka dataset](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/Financial).
The problem looks into how many loans have turned bad (where customer couldnâ€™t repay) from already available data and predicts whether a loan will turn bad or not for new customers. If it will turn bad, ABC bank may choose not to lend him/her. This is a binary classification problem that classifies a loan as good (quality asset) or bad(default)
