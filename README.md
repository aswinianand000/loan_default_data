# loan_default_data
The dataset we propose to use is Berka dataset for financial institution. The problem looks into how many loans have turned bad (where customer couldnâ€™t repay) from already available data and predicts whether a loan will turn bad or not for new customers. If it will turn bad, ABC bank may choose not to lend him/her. This is a binary classification problem that classifies a loan as good (quality asset) or bad(default).
